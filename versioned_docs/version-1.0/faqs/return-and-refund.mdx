  <summary>How to Return Your Glasses?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Several simple instructions as follows:
      <br />
      Contact JOO'RTI via e-mail at support#nineglasses.com within 14 days of
      receiving your eyeglasses. All Returns must be returned in their unworn,
      original condition.
      <br />
      Package your glasses securely and leave a note including your name, order
      number, e-mail box used when you placed the order and a brief note
      describing the returning reason of the glasses; or a copy of the
      prescription as well as PD that you received from a doctor, so that
      JOO'RTI can inspect the glasses.
      <br />
      JOO'RTI would feel sorry if your glasses were getting lost during the
      shipment. Therefore, shipping your return by a traceable method is
      recommended.
      <br />
      Tips: we are NOT responsible for the return postage, so you need to bear
      the postage by yourself.
