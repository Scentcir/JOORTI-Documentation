  <summary>How do I get my prescription?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      If you do not know your prescription, you can visit your local optician or optometrist and ask them to conduct an eye test. When you are finished, be sure to ask for a copy of your full prescription, including your PD (pupillary distance)
<br />
Eye tests are available at most opticians, however please be aware that not all opticians offer one-time eye tests. Please make sure that your eye test is comprehensive (which should include the use of an eye chart) and that you leave with all of the relevant information:
<br />
• The sphere (S, SF or SPH) and/or cylinder value of each eye (C or CYL).<br />
• If there is a cylinder value, then there must also be an axis value (A, As, AXI, AXS or AXIS).<br />
• The pupillary distance (PD) - the distance between the centre points of both pupils.

  <summary>What is my PD? It's not on my prescription</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      No need to worry! you can also get a friend to help you out. Ask them to
      hold a ruler to your brow, and measure the distance (in millimetres)
      between the centre of both pupils. The average is around 63mm, but it can
      be higher or lower.

  <summary>Do you provide bifocals or progressive lenses?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Yes we do! Once you click "Prescription", you'll be shown another
      selection of lens options which includes bifocals and progressives.

  <summary>What is ADD?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      The Add, short for Reading Addition, is the additional correction required
      for reading. It can be used to make either reading glasses, bifocal
      glasses or multifocal glasses. If you choose the bifocal/progressive lens,
      the ADD number should be included in your prescription.
      <br />
      This figure is an indication of how much extra power is required ‘on top’
      of the distance prescription for near or intermediate glasses. This extra
      power will ALWAYS be the same for each eye and may only appear once on
      your prescription but it is understood to be meant for both eyes. The
      measurement is the Dioptre, and most values range from +0.50 to +3.50 and
      will go up in steps of 0.25.
      <br />
      The 'addition' is only required if the glasses are going to be used for
      reading or close work. If your glasses are for distance only, this will
      not be an issue. Please kindly note that if you have ADD and choose
      distance glasses, the glasses can only be used for seeing far, not
      available for reading. Sometimes opticians use the word 'Add' or 'Near'
      instead of 'addition'. They may only write it once, but it normally
      applies to both eyes and is almost always the same value for both eyes
      (e.g. 'Add' +2.50 - should be entered for both eyes).
