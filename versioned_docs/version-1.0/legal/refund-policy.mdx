# Refund policy

## Returns Policy
<p>We want you to be 100% happy with your eyewear. With our 14-Day Fit &amp; Style Guarantee, you can make a return for a one-time replacement or refund within two weeks of receiving your order, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Our 365-Day Product Guarantee means Customers are eligible for a one-time replacement pair within 12 months. A replacement pair will only be issued if there are clear defects in material and workmanship.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Both warranties do not cover damage and/or return requests caused by accidents, negligence, or improper care. A shipping fee may apply for one-time replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> we are&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;responsible for the return postage, so you need to bear the postage by yourself.</p>
