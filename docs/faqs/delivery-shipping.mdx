    What can I do if I am required to pay import taxes or customs duties?
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Customs duty is a tax levied on imports (and, sometimes, on exports) by
      the customs authorities of a country to raise state revenue, and/or to
      protect domestic industries from more efficient or predatory competitors
      from abroad.
      <br />
      Customs duty is required in some countries occasionally.
      <br />
      a. Once you are informed to pay the duty fee (and if it is less than
      US$30), please pay it. Then send the invoice copy to
      support#nineglasses.com, and we will reimburse you.
      <br />
      b. If the duty fee is more than US$30 or higher than your order amount,
      please contact us first, so we will resend you a new package as what you
      had ordered.
      <br />
      Note: We won't reimburse for customs duty paid by customers without
      JOO’RTI's confirmation.
