      As we strive to provide quick turnaround times for all of our glasses, it
      is difficult to accommodate cancellations.
      <br />
      You may cancel an order within 24 hours of purchasing your glasses and we
      will refund you in full as soon as possible.
      <br />
      If you would like to cancel but the glasses have already been shipped, you
      can return the glasses to us once you have received them. See our returns
      page here for more info on this.
