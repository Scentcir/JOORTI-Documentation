  <summary>What is the material of your lens?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Our lenses are made of resin, which is lightweight and highly
      impact-resistant. Resin lenses also have a strong ability to block
      ultraviolet radiation to protect your eyes.

  <summary>How to choose lenses?</summary>

      This predominantly depends on the strength of your prescription. The
      higher the prescription, the higher index is required for ensuring your
      lenses are as light and thin as possible.

  <summary>Difference between Spherical Lens and Aspherical Lens</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Generally speaking, spherical lenses are thick and the images through the
      lenses will be distorted. While, with the same prescription and index,
      aspherical lenses are thinner, lighter and more comfortable for wearers.
      Aspherical lenses have a wider vision and the images through the lenses
      are more real and natural. Wearers will not feel tired after wearing
      aspherical lenses for a long time.

    What're the difference between Tint lens, Photochromic lens and Polarized
    lens?
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      The effect of the tinted lens is thoroughly and only one tint color no
      matter indoor or outside.
      <br />
      The photochromic lens is transparent indoor while color darkens outside.
      <br />
      The polarized lens has the same color indoor and outdoor, and their effect
      is better than the tinted lens and can filter harmful UV.

    What is the difference between single-vision and progressive lenses?
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Single vision lenses refer to the lens that has only one use, to see
      objects in the distance, to see intermediate like computer or phone, or to
      see near for reading (reading glasses).
      <br />
      While progressives are a type of prescription eyeglasses that can be used
      to correct both near and farsightedness. This means you can see your whole
      field of vision without switching between multiple pairs of glasses.

  <summary>What are Polarized lenses?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      A Polarized lens is a sunglasses lenses that greatly reduces the glare
      from light that is Polarized horizontally, meaning the light reflecting
      off horizontal surfaces, such as a white sidewalk, a white-sand beach,
      snow, or sunlight reflecting on the water.

  <summary>Can I buy lenses only to fit into my old glasses frame?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      No, we offer our lenses with our frames as a whole package. We strongly
      suggest not to do it as the lenses may not be suitable for your old
      eyeglasses frame if you buy them only.
      <br />
      What's more, the best service life of a frame is about one year. The frame
      may be deformed and faded after being used for one year. So, changing
      frame when necessary is good for your vision and looking.

    How to choose the lenses thickness? What is the relationship between lenses
    thickness and the refractive index?
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      The higher the refractive index, the thinner the lens, the more the light
      transmittance.

  <summary>How to use progressive glasses?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      It may take a few weeks to familiarise yourself with progressive lenses as
      they have different strength lenses incorporated into one frame.
      <br />
      The upper portions of your lenses are clear. As you lower your eyes, the
      magnification increases gradually allowing you to see better at different
      close-up distances.
      <br />
      Adapting to any new lenses requires a short adjustment period. The
      shortest and surest way to adapt is to stick with one design. Remove them
      temporarily if you feel you need a break. As you adapt, your eyes will
      begin to find the area of sharpest reading vision automatically.
      <br />
      At first, when you walk or move your head rapidly, objects to the side may
      appear to move slightly. This sensation will disappear quickly with
      continued use. Your progressive lenses have your distance, intermediate,
      and reading prescription all in one. You may find that walking down the
      stair is a bit difficult initially as the bottom of your lens is
      predominantly for the purpose of reading. It will get easier as you wear
      them more and your eyes start to get used to the lenses.
      <br />
      The lenses will provide the most natural vision possible and have all the
      adjustments for sight requires in one convenient lens.
