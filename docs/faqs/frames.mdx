      Lens index: Applying higher index lenses (1.60 index and above) can solve
      the problem of having a thick edge on a Negative lens, or a thick center
      on a Positive lens.
      <br />
      • Combining a higher index lens with an aspheric shape results in a lens
      which is noticeably thinner and lighter, bringing better vision, and a
      more comfortable wearing experience.
      <br />
      • Farsighted lenses: For farsighted wearers (there is "+" in front of SPH
      value) who want to select a higher index lens above 1.60, please note, the
      maximum size of a high index positive lens is relatively small (just
      55mm), so we recommend that customers choose a frame no wider than 50mm.
      <br />• Small PD: For wearers that have a comparatively small PD (the
      distance between your pupils is less than 58mm), please pay more attention
      to the total width of the frame as a larger frame may not match your PD. A
      smaller frame with a lens width of 50mm or lower should be considered as
      the first choice in order to ensure the accuracy of your prescription.

  <summary>How to measure the size of eyeglasses?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Step 1: Use a metric ruler. <br />
      Use a metric ruler with millimeters markings, the universal unit of measurement
      set by worldwide frame manufacturers and opticians.
      <br />
      Step 2: Place the frame properly. <br />
      Place the frame on a table or level surface. The arms can be closed or
      open.
      <br />
      Step 3: Align the ruler and make measurements. <br />
      Align the starting end of the ruler with the one side of the frame at the outer
      edge of the lens, then measure the distance to the outer edge at the other
      side of the frame. The bridge length can be measured in a similar way.
      <br />
      Step 4: Measure arm(temple). <br />
      It is necessary to measure the total length of the arm. First measure to
      the bend and then add the length of the drop for the total temple length.
      Providing the correct measurements for the frame will ensure your new
      eyeglasses fit comfortably.
